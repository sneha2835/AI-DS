# AI-DS
Welcome to the repository for the AI/DS internship project, sponsored by TekWorks! This project is focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science (DS) techniques to develop meaningful solutions to real-world problems.

Internship Objective: To showcase the application of machine learning algorithms, data processing techniques, and AI models to solve various business and technical challenges within the field of Data Science.

Project Overview
This project is part of my internship program sponsored by TekWorks. The main goal of the internship is to apply AI and Data Science concepts to build tools and models that can be leveraged to make data-driven decisions, automate processes, or create predictive models. The repository includes various algorithms, datasets, and project tasks undertaken during the internship period.

Technologies Used
This project utilizes several tools and technologies commonly used in AI and Data Science:

Programming Languages :  Python
Libraries :
Pandas (Data Manipulation)
NumPy (Mathematical Operations)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
TensorFlow / Keras (Deep Learning, if applicable)
Jupyter Notebooks (Code and Documentation)
SQL (Data Querying)
Plotly (Interactive Visualizations)
